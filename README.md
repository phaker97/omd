# omd

**omd** is a simple, fast, and lightweight Markdown renderer and previewer written in Rust. It allows you to convert Markdown files to HTML and preview them in your browser, either statically or with live-reload support.

## Features

- **Static Mode**: Convert Markdown files to HTML and open them directly in your default browser without running a server.
- **Server Mode**: Run a local server to preview your Markdown files with live-reload functionality as you edit them.
- **CommonMark Extensions**: Supports strikethrough, tables, footnotes, task lists, etc.
- **Customizable Styling**: Includes default CSS styling, which can be customized by editing `style.css`.
- **Embedded Fonts and Favicon**: Uses embedded fonts and favicon for a consistent look and self-contained HTML output.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for building from source)

### Build from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ptrglbvc/omd.git
   cd omd
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Install**

   Optionally, you can install `omd` to your local Cargo bin directory:

   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```

   This allows you to run `omd` from anywhere on your system.

### Get it from crates.io

   ```bash
   cargo install omd
   ```

   That is it.

## Usage

```
omd [OPTIONS] [FILE]
```

### Options

- `-s`, `--static-mode`: Run in static mode. Converts the Markdown file to HTML and opens it in your default browser without starting a server.

### Examples

#### Static Mode

Convert a Markdown file to HTML and open it in your browser:

```bash
omd --static-mode README.md
```

If no file is specified, `omd` will read from `stdin`:

```bash
cat README.md | omd --static-mode
```

#### Server Mode (Live Preview)

Start a local server to preview your Markdown file with live-reload functionality:

```bash
omd README.md
```

Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) in your browser. Whenever you save changes to `README.md`, the browser will automatically reload to reflect the updates.

Note that it will crash if the port is taken, like for example if you have another instance of omd openned. To solve this change the port number with the `--port` flag. Like so:

```bash
omd --port 6969 README.md
```

## How It Works

- **Static Mode**: Renders the Markdown to HTML, writes it to a temporary file, and opens it in your default browser.
- **Server Mode**: Starts a local web server using [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) and watches the Markdown file for changes using [Notify](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify). The browser automatically reloads when changes are detected.

## Dependencies

- [Pulldown-Cmark](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark) for parsing and rendering Markdown.
- [Warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) for running the web server in server mode.
- [Notify](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify) for watching file changes.
